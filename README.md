- LG webOS TVs (2016 and newer models)

### Jellyseerr Setup (Optional)

5. Test the connection, then start discovering!

Your session is saved securely and will reconnect automatically.

### Sideloading Instructions
1. Enable Developer Mode on your LG TV
2. Install the webOS Dev Mode app from the LG Content Store
3. Use the ares-cli tools to install the IPK (see Building from Source section)

---

## Building from Source

### Prerequisites
- Node.js and npm
- webOS SDK (ares-cli tools)

### Quick Start

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Development server
npm run serve

# Build for production
npm run pack -p

# Package for webOS (creates IPK)
npm run pack

# Install to TV
npm run install-tv

# Launch on TV
npm run launch-tv
```

### Managing the ares-tools via npm

The webOS ares-cli tools are included as a dev dependency. After running `npm install`, you can package and deploy the app.

### Testing on TV

Testing on a TV requires [registering a LG developer account](https://webostv.developer.lge.com/login) and [setting up the devmode app](https://webostv.developer.lge.com/develop/getting-started/developer-mode-app).

Once you have installed the devmode app on your target TV and logged in with your LG developer account, you need to turn on the `Dev Mode Status` and `Key Server`.
**Make sure** to take a note of the passphrase.

```bash
# Add your TV
ares-setup-device (manual) or ares-setup-device -s (network scan - set name to tv)

# Set up SSH key (Key Server must be running)
ares-novacom --device tv --getkey

# Verify connection
ares-device -i -d tv

# Install the app
ares-install -d tv build/*.ipk

# Launch with inspector
ares-inspect -d tv org.moonfin.webos

# Or just launch
ares-launch -d tv org.moonfin.webos
```
